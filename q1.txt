DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOCUMENT AND WINDOWS:

DOCUMENT:
The document object represents the HTML document itself and provides methods and properties to interact with the content of the document.
 You can manipulate the structure, style, and content of the webpage using the document object.

WINDOWS:
On the other hand, the window object represents the browser window and acts as the global object for JavaScript in the browser. 
It contains properties and methods related to the browser itself, like the size of the window, navigation history, and the global scope.


DIFFERENCE:
In a nutshell, document focuses on the content within the browser window, while window deals with the browser itself and its overall environment. 
They work together to enable dynamic and interactive web pages.
